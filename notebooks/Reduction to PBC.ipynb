    "Any approximately universal circuit $C$ on $|0\\rangle^n$ with only clifford and T gates and measurements in the Z basis can be transformed into PBC circuit $\\tilde{C}$ with magic state input $|{A}\\rangle^t$ where $|A\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}|1\\rangle$.  The outcome of $C$ is weakly simulated by the measurement of $\\tilde{C}$ and a classicaly polytime computation."
